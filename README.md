# cmpe50_lab2
In Spring 2019, I took a college class called 'Object-Oriented Programming and Methodology'. Its course number is CMPE 50. It was very helpful, but I struggled with the labs. One year later (Spring 2020), I became a TA for the class, and so I still have access to the labs. I have thus decided to re-do these programming labs in order to hone and review my C++ skills/knowledge.  

This repository stores my new Lab 2 code.
